    If you were to have a
    script similar to the above on your server, the client would receive
    the results of running that script, with no way of determining what
    the underlying code may be. You can even configure your web server
    to process all your HTML files with PHP, and then there's really no
    way that users can tell what you have up your sleeve.

    The first version
    used by others was available sometime in early 1995 and was known
    as the Personal Home Page Tools.  It consisted of a very
    simplistic parser engine that only understood a few special macros
    and a number of utilities that were in common use on home pages
    back then.  A guestbook, a counter and some other stuff.  The
    parser was rewritten in mid-1995 and named PHP/FI Version 2.  The
    FI came from another package Rasmus had written which interpreted
    html form data.  He combined the Personal Home Page tools scripts
    with the Form Interpreter and added mSQL support and PHP/FI was
    born.  PHP/FI grew at an amazing pace and people started
    contributing code to it.
   </simpara>
   <simpara>
    It is difficult to give any hard statistics, but it is estimated
    that by late 1996 PHP/FI was in use on at least 15,000 web sites
    around the world.  By mid-1997 this number had grown to over
    50,000.  Mid-1997 also saw a change in the development of PHP.  It
    changed from being Rasmus' own pet project that a handful of
    people had contributed to, to being a much more organized team
    effort. The parser was rewritten from scratch by Zeev Suraski and
    Andi Gutmans and this new parser formed the basis for PHP Version
    3.  A lot of the utility code from PHP/FI was ported over to PHP 3
    and a lot of it was completely rewritten.
   </simpara>
   <simpara>
    Today (10/2000) PHP 3 or PHP 4 now ships with a number of
    commercial products such as C2's StrongHold web server and RedHat
    Linux. A conservative estimate based on an extrapolation from
    numbers provided by <ulink url="&url.netcraft;">NetCraft</ulink>
    (see also <ulink url="&url.netcraft-survey;">Netcraft Web Server
    Survey</ulink>) would be that PHP is in use on over 3,300,000
    sites around the world.  To put that in perspective, that is more
    sites than run Netscape's flagship Enterprise server on the
    Internet, and close to the total number of IIS servers on the
    Internet (3.8 million).

   <simpara>
	The latest version (PHP 4) uses the powerful <ulink 
	url="&url.zend;">Zend</ulink> scripting engine to deliver higher
    performance, and also supports running under webservers other
    than Apache as a native server module.
