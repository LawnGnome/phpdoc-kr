    These functions check whether a character or string
    falls into a certain character class according to the i
    current locale.

   <para>
    When called with an integer argument theese functions 
    behave exactly like their C counterparts.
   </para>
   <para>
    When called with a string argument they will check
    every character in the string and will only return
    &true; if every character in the string matches the
    requested criteria.
   </para>
   <para>
    Passing anything else but a string or integer will 
    return &false; immediately.
   </para>
   <warning>
    <simpara>
     These functions are new as of PHP 4.0.4 and might change their
     name in the near future.  Suggestions are to change them to
     <function>ctype_issomething</function> instead of
     <function>ctype_somthing</function> or even to make them part of
     <filename>ext/standard</filename> and use their original C-names,
     although this would possibly lead to further confusion regarding
     the <function>isset</function>
     vs. <function>is_sometype</function> problem.
